## Recent projects (Python)
### [CSV Batcher](https://github.com/tangledpath/csv-batcher)
**_Scaling vertically with CSVs and/or Pandas_** -- a lightweight, python-based, multiprocess CSV batcher suitable for use with dataframes or other tools that deal with large CSV files (or those that require timely processing).

### [Python Arango Object Graph Model](https://github.com/tangledpath/python-arango-ogm)
**_Scaling vertically with CSVs and/or Pandas_** -- Python-based package implementing an OGM (Object Graph Model) framework for arango; built on top of [python-arango]([url](https://github.com/arangodb/python-arango/)).  Capabilities include model-like access to graph objects, and a migration mechanism that generates migrations from your defined models; similar to how Django builds its migrations. This is somewhat a work-in-progress as I integrate it back into the closed-source project from which it was extracted.

## Previous Projects
### [Ruby-Fann](https://github.com/tangledpath/ruby-fann)
RubyFann, or "ruby-fann" is a Ruby Gem (no Rails required) that binds natively to FANN (Fast Artificial Neural Network) from within a ruby/rails environment. FANN is a is a free native open source neural network library, which implements multilayer artificial neural networks, supporting both fully-connected and sparsely-connected networks. It is easy to use, versatile, well documented, and fast. RubyFann makes working with neural networks a breeze using ruby, with the added benefit that most of the heavy lifting is done natively.

### [PathMaster](https://github.com/tangledpath/pathmaster)
[Aâ˜…](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) pathfinding in Unity 3D via AutoWaypoints. This was part of a Unity game that didn't make it to market. Since Unity now has pathfinding built-in, we are open-sourcing this for posterity.
