As an innovative technology leader, I offer more than 20 years of unique experience that blends software engineering, technical leadership, and team coaching. Because I have worked for enterprise-level companies, startups, and nonprofits, I am also skilled at adapting quickly to changing organizational and market demands.

My passion lies in identifying and capturing emerging technology opportunities that can transform businesses â€“ enabling teams to focus on higher-level functions and positioning companies at the forefront of their industries. Excited about what AI, software engineering, data engineering, can do for businesses and the world, I enjoy collaborating across both technical and nontechnical teams to guide the integration of technology to ensure it supports business demands.
